# Statistical and causal inference for policy change

Most of this this document dives into the details of our statistical decision
making and assumes that the reader has heard of a hypothesis test and a
statistical estimator. However, here we explain in very broad terms how tests
and estimators help us do our job in helping the US federal government improve
public policy.

Recall that "evidence-based public policy" can refer to *both*
"evidence-as-insight" (the use of previous scientific literature as input to
the design of new policies) and "evidence-as-evaluation" (the careful design of
studies to learn about how and whether a new policy worked)
[@bowers2019better].  Our team aims to help government agencies **design** new
policies and also to **learn** about how those new ideas work. **This document
focuses on the learning part of our work.**

How would we know whether and how a new policy worked? In an ideal and
unrealistic case, we would know that a new policy improved the life of a single
person, Jake, if we could compare Jake's decisions *both* under the new policy
*and* under the status quo *at the same moment in time*. If we saw that Jake's
decisions were better under the new policy than under the status quo, we would
say that the new policy caused Jake to make better decisions. Since no one can
observe Jake in both situations --- say, making health decisions both with and
without a new procedure for visiting the doctor --- researchers try to find at
least one other person (if not more) who represents how Jake would have acted
if he had not been exposed to the new policy. @holland:1986a calls this problem
the "fundamental problem of causal inference" and explains more formally about
when we might believe that other people are a good example of how Jake would
have acted without the new policy, for example, when we have randomized access
to the new policy, we can claim that that the two groups are good
counterfactuals for each other. That is, our team tends to think about the
*causal effects* of a policy in *counterfactual* terms.

What do statistics have to do with learning about the causal effect of a new
policy idea?  We use randomized experiments to create groups of people who
represent *both* the decisions made under the new policy and the status quo. In
medical experiments to assess the effectiveness of new treatments, these two
groups tend to be called the "treatment group" and the "control group" and we
sometimes use that same language even if we are not really providing a new
treatment, but are, instead, offering a new communication or structure for a
decision. If we pilot the new policy with people chosen at random, we can claim
that the people chosen and the people not chosen represent each other. In a randomized study, we
can use what we see from one group to learn about what would have happened had
the other group instead received the treatment or new policy intervention.

Now, if our study has, say, 1000 people in it, we don't know for sure and
exactly how the other group would have behaved. For example, if we pulled 500
names from a hat, to divide the 1000 people into two groups, we would have one
set of 500 people. If we were to do the experiment again, to pull another 500
names at random, this second experiment will also be a randomized experiment,
but the second 500 people will be different from the first 500 people. This
means that, a single experiment offers us some information about the effect of
the treatment, but we need to ask a question like, "How much would our best
guess differ just because we could have pulled a different 500 people from the
hat?" We also need to answer questions like, "What do you mean by 'best guess'?
How do I know that this really is a good guess rather than a bad guess?"

Our team uses statistical theory to produce "best guesses" or "estimates" about
the causal effect of the new policy and we also use statistical theory to answer questions
about information like "Could the effect really have been zero?" or "How many
people do we need to observe in order to distinguish a positive effect from  a
zero effect?"

The rest of this document presents decisions we have made about the particulars
of estimators and tests, as well as other tricky decisions that we have had to
confront --- like what to do when some of data are missing. 

For more on the basics of how statistics helps us answer questions about causal
effects, we recommend chapters 1--3 of @gerber_field_2012 (which focuses on
randomized experiments) and the first part of @rosenbaum2017 (which focuses on
both experiments and research designs without randomization).
