# Using tests to inform policy

Most of the rest of this document dives into our statistical decision making. It assumes that the reader has heard of hypothesis tests and statistical estimators. Here, we first explain in broad terms how tests
and estimators are useful for helping the US federal government improve public policy.

"Evidence-based public policy" can refer to both "evidence-as-insight" (the use of previous scientific literature as input to the design of new policies) and "evidence-as-evaluation" (the careful design of studies to learn about how and whether a new policy worked). For more on this distinction, see @bowers2019better. Our team aims to help government agencies **design** new policies and **learn** about how well those new ideas work. The OES SOP focuses on the learning part of our work.

How would we know whether and how a new policy worked? In an ideal and
unrealistic case, we would know that a new policy improved the life of a single
person, John, if we could compare his decisions both under the new policy and under the status quo *at the same moment in time*. If we saw that John's decisions were better under the new policy than under the status quo, we would say that the new policy *caused* John to make better decisions.

Since no one can observe John in both situations --- say, making health decisions with and without a new procedure for visiting the doctor --- researchers try to find at least one other person (or more) who represents how John would have acted without being exposed to the new policy. @holland:1986a calls this the "fundamental problem of causal inference" and explains more formally when we might believe that other people are a good approximations for how John would have acted without the new policy. For example, if access to the new policy is randomized, it is easier to argue that that the two groups are good "counterfactuals" for each other. Our team tends to think about the causal effects of a policy in counterfactual terms.

This in mind, we often use randomized experiments to create groups of people who represent behavior under *both* the new policy and the status quo. In
medical experiments, these two groups tend to be called the "treatment group" and the "control group." Social scientists often use that same language even if we are not really providing a new treatment, but are, instead, offering a new communication or decision-making structure. If we pilot a new policy by offering it to people chosen at random, we can use what we see from one group to learn about what would likely have happened if the control group had received the new policy instead, or if the treatment group had not received it.

In any given sample, we won't know *exactly* how the treatment group would have behaved if they had been assigned to the control group instead. For example, imagine we pulled 500 out of 1000 names from a hat and assigned those 500 people to receive treatment. Any "treated" sample we observe is just one of many possible sets of 500 people we could have drawn. If we were to do the experiment again, and pulled a different 500 names at random, this second experiment will also have a randomly selected treatment group, but the second 500 people will be at least a little different from the first 500 people. It is important to ask questions about how this influences our findings ("statistical uncertainty"). How much could our result differ just due to pulling a different 500 people from the hat (rather than a real treatment effect)?

Our team draws on statistical theory to estimate the causal effect of a new policy and its associated statistical uncertainty. We also use statistical theory to answer questions like "Is this effect meaningfully distinguishable from zero?" or "How many people do we need to observe in order to distinguish a positive effect from a zero effect?" The rest of this document presents decisions we have made about the particulars of estimators and tests, as well as other tricky decisions that we have had to confront---like how we can learn from pre-intervention data to design experiments that provide more precise results.

For more on the basics of how statistics helps us answer questions about causal
effects, we recommend chapters 1--3 of @gerber_field_2012 (which focuses on
randomized experiments) and the first part of @rosenbaum2017 (which focuses on
both experiments and research designs without randomization). Another good treatment comes from the opening chapters of @angrist2009mostly.
