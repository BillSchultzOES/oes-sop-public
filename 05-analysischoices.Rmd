We've organized our discussion of analysis techniques around a study's randomization design. But there are a few general tactics that we use to ensure that we can make transparent, valid, and statistically precise statements about the results from our evaluations. We'll start this chapter by reviewing those.

First, the nature of the data that we expect to see from a given experiment informs our analysis plans. For example, we may make some choices based on the nature of the outcome---a binary outcome, a symmetrically distributed continuous outcome, and a heavily skewed continuous outcome each could each call for different analytical approaches.

Second, we tend to ask three different questions in each of our studies, and we answer them with different statistical procedures:

 1. Can we *detect an effect* in our experiment? (We use hypothesis tests to answer this question.)
 2. What is our best guess about the *size of the effect* of the experiment? (We estimate the average treatment effect of our interventions to answer this question.)
 3. *How precise* is our guess? (We report confidence intervals or standard errors to answer this question.)

Finally, in the [Analysis Plans](https://oes.gsa.gov/methodsdetail/#analysis-plans) that we post online before receiving outcome data for a project, we try to anticipate many common decisions involved in data analysis---how we will treat missing data, how we will rescale, recode, and combine columns of raw data, etc. We touch on some of these topics in more detail below, and will cover others further in the future.

## Completely randomized trials

### Two arms

#### Continuous outcomes

In a completely randomized trial where outcomes take on many levels (units
like times, counts of events, dollars, percentages, etc.) we generally assess the **weak null hypothesis** of no average treatment effect across units. We may also (or instead) assess the **sharp null hypothesis** of no effect for any unit. What we call the "weak null" here corresponds to the null evaluated by default in many software packages (like R and Stata) when implementing procedures like a difference-in-means test or a linear regression. Meanwhile, the sharp null is evaluated when relying on design-based randomization inference. Particularly in smaller samples, tests of the sharp null may be better powered [@reichardt1999justifying]. It may also be possible to justify a hypothesis test of the sharp null in some limited situations where justifying other procedures is more difficult [@rubin1986comment].^[As @rubin1986comment discusses, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) holds trivially when testing the sharp null via randomization inference. But this is not the case when estimating average treatment effects or testing the weak null. For instance, this can be useful for thinking through the difficult problem of evaluating impacts of "attributes" rather than manipulable treatments.]

##### Estimating the average treatment effect and testing the weak null of no average effects

We show the kind of code we use for these purposes here. Below, `Y` is the outcome variable and `Z` is an indicator of the assignment to treatment.

```

Notice that the standard errors that we use are not the default OLS errors:

```{r notolsse, eval = T, echo = F}
estAndSE1OLS <- lm(Y~Z,data=dat1)
summary(estAndSE1OLS)$coef
```

The standard errors we prefer, HC2, reflect repeated randomization from a fixed experimental pool (chapter 3). Specifically, @lin_agnostic_2013 and @samii_equivalencies_2012 show that the standard error estimator of an unbiased average treatment effect within a "finite-sample" or design based framework is equivalent to the HC2 standard error. In R, these SEs are produced by default by the `estimatr` package's function `difference_in_means()` and `lm_robust()`. They can also be produced, for instance, using the `vcovHC()` function from the `sandwich` package or the `lmtest` package's `coeftest()` and `coefci()` functions. In Stata, when using `regress`, these can be estimated using the `vce(hc2)` option (they are not the default used by the `robust` option). Some other commands offer a similar option; check the help file to see.

Our preference for HC2 errors follows from their design-based justification, but most researchers likely encounter them as one of several methods of correcting OLS standard errors for *heteroscedasticity*. Essentially, this means that the variance of the regression model's error term is not constant across observations. Classical OLS standard errors assume away heteroscedasticity, which may render them meaningfully inaccurate when heteroscedasticity is present. When using OLS to analyze data from a two-arm randomized trial, heteroscedasticity might appear because the variance of the outcome is different in the treatment and control groups. This is common.

##### Testing the sharp null of no effects

We may assess the sharp null of no effects via treatment permutation as a check on the assumptions underlying the calculations and statistical inferences above (i.e., "randomization inference"). We could use a $t$-statistic as our test statistic here to parallel the above tests. But we could also use a rank-based test statistic instead if we were concerned about long-tails (i.e., skew) reducing statistical power. In the interests of simplificity, we can even use treatment effect estimates themselves.

The basic procedure is as follows:

- Estimate the treatment effect of interest using the real treatment indicator: $\hat{\tau}_{real}$. As we note, you could use some other statistic here instead, such as a t-statistic or a rank-based statistic.

- Randomly reassign treatment $R$ times, each time following the same assignment procedure used originally. Estimate a treatment effect using each of the simulated re-assignments: $\hat{\tau}_{sim,r}$. This yields a distribution of treatment effects under the sharp null (the "randomization distribution").

- Compare the treatment effect to its randomization distribution to estimate a (two-sided) p-value: $\frac{1}{R}\sum_{r=1}^{R} \mathcal{1}(|\hat{\tau}_{real}| \leq |\hat{\tau}_{sim,r}|)$

Below, we show how to implement this approach using two different R packages and several Stata commands.  First, lets look at the `coin` package [@R-coin] in R and `permute` in Stata:

It is also relatively common for OES evaluations to encounter situations where these canned approaches aren't viable. It is useful to be able to program randomization inference manually. We provide templates for how this could be done in the code below, focusing on complete random assignment. This yields similar results to the canned functions above.

#### Binary outcomes

We tend to focus on differences in percentage points when we are working with binary outcomes, usually estimated via OLS linear regression. A statement like "the effect was a 5 percentage point increase" has made communication with partners easier than a discussion in terms of log odds or odds ratios. In addition to difficulties in interpretation and communication, we also avoid logistic regression coefficients because of a problem noticed by @freedman2008randomization in the case of covariance adjustment or more complicated research designs.

##### Estimating the average treatment effect and testing the weak null of no average effects

We can estimate effects and produce standard errors for differences of proportions using the same process as above. The average treatment effect estimate here represents the difference in the proportions of positive responses (i.e., $Y=1$) between treatment conditions. The standard error is still valid because it is calculated using a procedure justified by the study's design.

When we have an experiment that includes a treatment and control group with binary outcomes, and when we are estimating the ATE, the standard error from a difference in proportions test is similar to the design based feasible standard error for an average treatment effect (and therefore similar to HC2 errors). In contrast, classical OLS standard errors with a binary outcome---sometimes called a *linear probability model*---will be at least slightly incorrect due to inherent heteroscecdasticity [@angrist2009mostly].

To see this in more detail, consider that difference-in-proportion standard errors are estimated with the following equation:

$$\widehat{SE}_{prop} = \sqrt{\frac{p_{1}(1-p_{1})}{n_{1}}+\frac{p_{2}(1-p_{2})}{n_{2}}}$$

where $n_1$ is the size of the group assigned treatment, $n_2$ is the size of the group assigned control, $p_1$ is the proportion of "successes" in the group assigned treatment, and $p_2$iss the proportion of "successes" in the group assigned control. The fractions above represent the variance of the proportion in each group.

It's easy to compare this with the feasible standard error equation from chapter 3:

$$\widehat{SE}_{feasible} = \sqrt{\frac{\var(Y_{t})}{n_1}+\frac{\var(Y_{c})}{n_2}}$$

$Y_c$ is the vector of observed outcomes under control, and $Y_t$ is the vector of observed outcomes under treatment. This equation indicates that we use the observed variances in each treatment group to estimate the feasible design based standard error for an average treatment effect. The code below compares the various standard error estimators discussed here (we refer to the design based SEs as Neyman SEs).

##### Testing the sharp null of no effects

With a binary treatment and a binary outcome, we could test hypothesis that outcomes are totally independent of treatment assignment using what is called *Fisher's exact test*. We can also use the permutation-based approaches above to avoid relying on asymptotic (large-sample) assumptions. Below we show how Fisher's exact test, the Exact Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, and the Exact $\chi$-squared test produce the same answers.

A difference-in-proportions test can also be performed directly (rather than relying on OLS to approximate this). In that case, the null hypothesis is tested while using a binomial distribution (rather than a Normal distribution) to approximate the underlying randomization distribution. In reasonably-sized samples, both approximations perform well.

## Multiple tests

### Multiple arms

Multiple treatment arms can be analyzed as above, except that we now have
more than one comparison between a treated group and a control group. Such studies raise both substantive and statistical questions about multiple
testing (or "multiple comparisons"). For example, the `difference_in_means`
function asks which average treatment effect it should estimate, and it
only presents one comparison at a time. We *could* compare the treatment `T2`
with the baseline outcome of `T1`. But we *could also* compare both of `T2` and `T3` with `T1` at the same time, as in the second set of results (`lm_robust` implements the same standard errors as `difference_in_means`, but allows for more flexible model specification).

print(estAndSE3)
estAndSE3multarms <- lm_robust(Y~Z4arms,data=dat1)
print(estAndSE3multarms)
```

In this case, we could make $((4 \times 4)-4)/2)=6$ different possible comparisons between pairs of treatment groups. Consider that if there were really no effect of any treatment, and if we chose to reject the null across treatments at the standard significance threshold of $\alpha=.05$, we would incorrectly claim that there was at least one effect *more than 5% of the time*. $1 - ( 1 - .05)^6 = .27$, or 27% of the time, we would make a false positive error, claiming an effect existed when it did not.

Two points are worth emphasizing. First, the "family-wise error rate" (FWER) will differ from the individual error rate of any single test. In short, performing multiple tests to draw a conclusion about a single underlying hypothesis increases our chances of incorrectly rejecting a true null at least once. Suppose that we calculated two p-values and compared each to the conventional significance level $\alpha = 0.05$. The probability of retaining (failing to reject) both hypotheses is $(1-\alpha)^2 = .9025$ and the probability of rejecting at least one of these hypotheses is $1-(1-\alpha)^2 = .0975$---almost double our intended significance threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$ across tests.

Second, multiple tests will often be correlated, and corrections for multiple testing should recognize these relationships. Importantly, accounting for this correlation *will penalize multiple testing less*. When we say that tests are "correlated," we mean that there is some relationship between the test statistics (e.g., a student's t-statistic, or a $\chi^{2}$ statistic) used to perform statistical inference. In other words, the test statistics are jointly distributed---when one test statistic is higher, the other will tend to be higher as well.^[Imagine testing two hypotheses with $\alpha = .05$, but the assumed reference distributions for the test statistics were identical: by accident, we ran the same exact code twice. In that case, we are really just doing one test and so we haven't changed our probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis for either test. If the two tests were instead correlated at .99, we would have changed this probability but only very slightly, since both tests would basically still be the same.]

Our default procedure for evaluating multi-arm trials is as follows:

 - First, decide on an omnibus **confirmatory** comparison for the entire evaluation: say, control/status quo *versus* receiving any version of the treatment. Such a test would likely have more statistical power than a test that evaluates each arm separately, and would also have a correctly controlled false positive rate. This would then serve as the primary finding we report.

 - Second, perform the rest of the comparisons as **exploratory** analyses without multiple testing adjustment---i.e., as analyses that may inform future projects and suggest where we might be seeing more or less of an effect, but which cannot serve as a foundation for policy conclusions on their own.
 
 - Alternatively, if we do want to make multiple confirmatory comparisons, we need to adjust their collective false positive rate.^[We generally seek to control the FWER, but sometimes consider controlling the false discovery rate, or FDR, instead. Holding the FDR at 20%, for example, implies trying to ensure that only 20% of reported test results (or 1 in 5) are a false positive. This contrasts with adjustments to control the FWER, which focus on the probability of observing one or more false positives across tests.] The most appropriate method varies. Options include: canned procedures like Bonferroni adjustment, particularly if test statistics should not be correlated; the Tukey HSD procedure for pairwise comparisons of multiple treatment arms; simulations to calculate a significance threshold that properly controls the collective error rate;^[Generally, we would use simulation method based on randomization inference; see the coded examples below. Though this is less common in social science, studies in other disciplines sometimes simulate the joint distribution of the test statistics instead [@conneely2007so]. This often requires either estimating or assuming the correlation between test statistics.] or performing the tests in a specific order to protect the familywise error rate [@rosenbaum2008a].

#### Adjusting p-values and confidence intervals for multiple comparisons

We review some of the adjustments listed above in more detail, with coded examples.

First, if we want to rely on established procedures that only require the p-values themselves, we might hold the familywise error rate at $\alpha$ through either a single step correction (e.g. [Bonferroni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction)) or a stepwise correction (such as [Holm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm%E2%80%93Bonferroni_method)). We could also use a procedure control the false discovery rate (e.g., using the [Benjamini-Hochberg correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate#Benjamini.E2.80.93Hochberg_procedure)). As mentioned above, these adjustments assume the test statistics are uncorrelated. Our default practice when dealing with multiple uncorrelated tests is to apply the Holm correction. For more, see EGAP's [10 Things you need to know about multiple comparisons](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-multiple-comparisons/).

However, simply adjusting $p$-values from this linear model ignores the fact that we may be interested in other pairwise comparisons, such as the difference in effects between receiving `T3` vs `T4`. And we could be leaving meaningful statistical power "on the table" by applying procedures that ignore correlations between our test statistics.

A different option when dealing with multiple comparisons is to implement a [Tukey Honestly Signficant Differences (HSD) test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukey%27s_range_test). The Tukey HSD test (sometimes called a Tukey range test or just a
Tukey test) calculates multiple-comparison-adjusted $p$-values and simultaneous confidence intervals *for all pairwise comparisons* in a model, while taking into account possible correlations between test statistics. It is similar to a two-sample t-test, but with built in adjustment for multiple comparisons. The test statistic for any comparison between two equally-sized groups $i$ and $j$ is:

$$ t_{ij} = \frac{\bar{y_i}-\bar{y_j}}{s\sqrt{\frac{2}{n}}} $$

$\bar{y_i}$ and $\bar{y_j}$ are the means in groups $i$ and
$j$, respectively. $s$ is the pooled standard deviation of the outcome, and $n$ is the common sample size. A critical value is then chosen for $t_{ij}$ given the desired significance level, $\alpha$, the number of groups being compared, $k$, and the degrees of freedom, $n-k$. We'll represent this critical value with $t_{\alpha,k,n}$.

The confidence interval for any difference between equally-sized groups is then:^[We focus on the classic Tukey HSD procedure for this illustration, which assumes equally sized groups. There are modifications to apply this procedure in other settings, such as the Tukey-Kramer test.]

$$\left[\bar{y_i}-\bar{y_j}-t_{\alpha,k,n}s\sqrt{\frac{2}{n}}\hspace{2mm},\hspace{2mm} \bar{y_i}-\bar{y_j}+t_{\alpha,k,n}s\sqrt{\frac{2}{n}}\right]$$

We present an R implementation of the Tukey HSD test using the `glht()` function from the `multcomp` package, which offers more flexiblity than the
`TukeyHSD` in the base `stats` package (at the price of a slightly more complicated syntax). We also illustrate a few options in Stata. But to perform this post-hoc test, we first need to fit an applicable model.

```

In R, using the `glht()` function's `linfcnt` argument, we tell the function to conduct a Tukey test of all pairwise comparisons for our treatment indicator, $Z$. In Stata, we can do this using the `tukeyhsd` command or `pwcompare` commands.

Focusing on the R results, we can then plot the 95% family wise confidence intervals for these comparisons.

```{r tukeyplot}
## Save dfault ploting parameters
op <- par()
## Add space to left-hand outer margin
par(oma = c(1, 3, 0, 0))
plot(tukey_mc)
```

We can also obtain simultaneous confidence intervals at other levels of statistical significance using the `confint()` function.

```{r plot_tukey_ci, warnings=FALSE}
## Generate and plot 90% confidence intervals
tukey_mc_90ci <- confint(tukey_mc, level = .90)
plot(tukey_mc_90ci)
## Restore plotting defaults, now
par(op)
```

See also, in R: `pairwise.prop.test` for binary outcomes.

Finally, when test statistics are correlated but a Tukey-styled test is not desirable, we could instead employ randomization inference. To do this, we would start by simulating the distribution of p-values observed for each test across many random permutations of treatment (estimating the "randomization distribution" of our correlated test statistics under the sharp null). After that, we would use the distribution of p-values to calculate an *alternative significance threshold*. By comparing our real p-values to this simulated threshold, we could evaluate statistical significance while properly controling the FWER. We provide examples below for R and Stata. See step 7 on [this page](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-multiple-comparisons/) for an alternative R code example.

In the code below, we first define a function to randomly re-assign treatment and estimate a p-value for each regression coefficient (based on HC2 errors). We repeatedly call this function 1000 times and save the resulting distribution of p-values. We then define two more functions (`find_threshold1` and `find_threshold2`) that illustrate two different methods of calculating an appropriate significance threshold using those p-values (the first may be a little slower, but it walks through the logic in more detail). We also use this simulation to illustrate the advantages of an omnibus approach where we simply perform our confirmatory test using an alternative indicator for receipt of one of the treatment arms.

Both calculation approaches yield similar significance thresholds. And the collective false positive rate when making multiple comparisons is noticably higher than when making a single, omnibus comparison.

### Multiple outcomes

Our studies also often involve more than one outcome measure. Assessing the effects of even a simple two-arm treatment across 10 different outcomes can raise the same kinds of questions that come up in the context of multi-arm trials. Classic adjustments such as the Bonferroni and Holm procedures (which ignore correlations between test statistics), testing hypotheses in a pre-specified order [@rosenbaum2008a], and randomization inference simulations could all be appropriate adjustments to apply when dealing with multiple outcomes (whereas the Tukey HSD procedure is specifically for multiple comparisons).

Additionally, as we did with multiple comparisons, we can perform omnibus tests for an overall treatment effect across multiple outcomes. One method we'll highlight is creating a "stacked" regression model, where each observation has a separate row in the dataset for each outcome measure [@oberfichtner2021stacked].^[For another method we don't discuss, see @rosenbaum2012testing.] A modified version of the original model with unit-clustered errors can then be fit to the stacked dataset, evaluating joint significance across outcomes using a Wald test (see chapter 4 for a summary of Wald tests). This approach usually yields the same or similar results to fitting separate tests for each outcome in a "seemingly unrelated estimation" (SUE) framework [@weesie2000seemlingly]. Which method is more convenient depends on the situation. We focus on stacked regression, but see `suest` in Stata or `systemfit` in R for guidance on implementing SUE.

The code below illustrates the stacked regression method using two simulated outcomes drawn from a multivariate normal distribution. First, we need to prepare the data.

Next, as above, we define a function to repeatedly permute treatment, estimate an omnibus p-value for an effect across outcomes using a stacked regression, and compare this to the collective false positive rate we observe when evaluating the tests separately. We perform the simulation by permuting treatment just to illustrate the collective false positive rate in a case where we know the null of no effect is true.

### When is this necessary?

So far, we've focused on the mechanics of performing different kinds of adjustments for multiple testing (different outcomes, multiple comparisons, multiple model specifications we are agnostic about, etc.). But we've avoided a more fundamental question: how do we determine when adjustment is necessary in the first place? Failing to apply a multiple testing correction when it is needed yields overconfident inferences. But adjusting when it is not needed yields overly conservative inferences. Both miscalculations work against our ability to correctly control error rates, one of our key design criteria (chapter 2).

This is an area where our thinking at OES has evolved over time. To see the logic for our current approach, consider the two hypothetical examples below.

In **Example 1**, we want to evaluate whether outreach increases enrollment in a public benefit program. Past research doesn't clarify which available outreach method is most effective, so we design a four-arm trial with a control group and three different intervention groups (texts, emails, and phone calls). We decide that if we see statistically significant evidence for the effectiveness of any treatment arm, this is sufficient to **reject the joint null hypothesis** of no effect across outreach methods, corresponding to $H_{0, joint}$ below, where $\cap$ means "and." Our primary concern is whether *at least one intervention* works.

$$H_{0, text} : \tau_{text} = 0$$
$$H_{0, email} : \tau_{email} = 0$$
$$H_{0, phone} : \tau_{phone} = 0$$

$$H_{0, joint} = H_{0, text} \cap H_{0, email} \cap H_{0, phone}$$

In contrast, in **Example 2**, we are evaluating two separate interventions to process benefit applications more quickly. This is a three-arm trial with a control group and two intervention groups, but the interventions are unrelated. We can justify each intervention separately, and there is no joint null we are interested in. Instead, we simply want to **reject the constituent null hypotheses** of no effect for each intervention, $H_{0, int1}$ and $H_{0, int2}$.

$$H_{0, int1} : \tau_{int1} = 0$$

$$H_{0, int2} : \tau_{int2} = 0$$
In Example 1, the joint null of no effect across outreach methods is the *intersection* of three constituent null hypotheses. Rejecting this null implies accepting the *union* of their alternative hypotheses (where $\cup$ means "or," and we have $H_{A, method} : \tau_{method} \neq 0$):

$$H_{A, joint} = H_{A, text} \cup H_{A, email} \cup H_{A, phone}$$
Rejecting any one of the constituent null hypotheses is grounds to reject $H_{0, joint}$. This is sometimes called a **union-intersection** test [@rubin2024inconsistent]. To maintain appropriate error rate control, we apply multiple testing adjustment whenever we base a conclusion on a union-intersection test. These are the situations where we are most concerned about being mislead by inflated error rates: where we are drawing one underlying conclusion based on the results of multiple tests.

In contrast, in example 2, the interventions are justified separately, and the truth of $H_{0, int1}$ has no bearing on the truth of $H_{0, int2}$. In this case, we have determined that it is not useful to only know that at least one of the two modifications decreased application processing times (i.e., rejecting the intersection of their nulls is not informative)---we need to know whether each modification on its own was sufficient. Therefore, we would not adjust for multiple testing. The FWER is inflated, but we are not drawing a joint conclusion. Moreover, the Type I error rates for the separate tests remain uninflated [@rubin2024inconsistent]. Returning to the three simulated p-values from the multiple arms adjustment example code, we can see that the estimated false positive rate under a true null is approximately correct when each test is considered alone.

```{r}
colMeans(multiple_arms[,c(3:5)] <= 0.05)
```

Lastly, consider the reverse of example 1: we wish to determine whether there is sufficient evidence that all three outreach methods work. This is sometimes called an **intersection-union** test. We would again not adjust for multiple testing when performing an intersection-union test. The risk of seeing at least one false positive is not compelling if our conclusion depends on seeing supportive results for all three outreach methods, rather than only one.

In sum, at OES we prefer to adjust for multiple testing when drawing conclusions based on union-intersection tests, but not in other cases. Put more simply, are we drawing a conclusion after looking for statistical significance in at least one of several tests? If so, we adjust for multiple testing. But otherwise we often elect not to. Researchers sometimes seek to define "families" of related tests to help determine where multiple testing adjustments are or are not needed. By the logic outlined above, two tests might be thought of as in the same "family" if they contribute to the same joint null hypothesis, as defined above for union-intersection tests $(H_{0, joint} : H_{0, 1} \cap H_{0, 2} \cap ... )$.

Determining which case above best represents any given evaluation is [a question of theory and policy relevance](https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/02-errorcontrol.html#why-you-dont-need-to-adjust-your-alpha-level-for-all-tests-youll-do-in-your-lifetime) as much as it is a statistical question. It may depend on what we hope to learn from an evaluation, and what kinds of conclusions would be most useful for our partners. It helps to carefully lay out and justify the claims we wish to make or evaluate as a part of pre-registering our analysis plans.

## Covariance adjustment (the use of background information to increase precision)

When we have additional information about experimental units (covariates), we can use this to increase the the statistical power of our tests. When possible, we use this information during the design phase to randomize interventions within blocks. But we also often pre-specify covariance adjustment as a part of our analyses.

Researchers typically do this by regressing the outcome on a treatment indicator and a set of linear, additive terms for each covariate (like $X_{i}$ in equation 3 below). This estimator of the average treatment effect is *consistent* (bias decreases as $n \rightarrow \infty$, i.e. asymptotically), but it can be biased in finite samples. The risk of appreciable bias is greater in small samples (see below). The unadjusted difference in means, in constrast, is unbiased, but as @lin_agnostic_2013 points out, this is not reassuring if, for instance, treatment and control groups are noticeably imbalanced despite randomization. Standard linear covariance adjustment can be less efficient than an unadjusted difference in means [@freedman2008rae].^[This becomes more likely as the probability of treatment gets further from 0.5, or if the relationship between covariates and treatment effect heterogeneity is stronger than the relationship between covariates and the potential outcomes. See @lin_agnostic_2013 p. 304, remark *v*.]

In contrast, an approach to covariance adjustment that we call the **Lin estimator** or **Lin adjustment** performs better---at worst, it will be no less asymptotically efficient than an unadjusted difference in means [@lin_agnostic_2013], and it often has a lower root mean squared error (RMSE) [@negi2021revisiting]. We explain how it is implemented below. Like linear covariance adjustment, the Lin estimator is generally consistent and not unbiased. But the Lin estimator will be unbiased if it correctly models the true conditional expectation of $Y$ given treatment and the covariates [@negi2021revisiting; @lin_agnostic_2013]. This condition is met when the model is "saturated" with controls for every combination of covariate values, such as when using the Lin estimator to account for a set of dummies representing block fixed effects [@miratrix2013adjusting]. 

The precision-loss attributable to standard linear covariance adjustment estimator can be quite small in large samples. Yet, because it is frequently costless to use the Lin estimator in large samples, it is our default recommendation (see [this page](https://declaredesign.org/blog/2018-09-11-controlling-pretreatment-covariates.html) as well). That said, it is not uncommon for us to encounter situations where linear covariate adjustment is still preferred, either on practical or statistical grounds. A few examples:

- The randomization design has only two arms, and the probability of receiving treatment is approximately 0.5

- We do not expect the covariates we observe to be associated with meaningful treatment effect heterogeneity

- The number of parameters in a model is large enough, relative to the sample size, that the loss of degrees of freedom from using Lin adjustment may be substantial (the number of terms added is the number of controls multipled by the number of treatments); Lin adjustment is more efficient *asymptotically*

We expand on some of these issues in the subsections below, with more detail on how Lin estimation works

### Possible bias in the least squares ATE estimator with covariates

When we estimate the average treatment effect using least squares we tend to say that we "regress" some outcome for each unit $i$, $Y_i$, on (often binary) treatment assignment, $Z_i$, where $Z_i=1$ if a unit is assigned to treatment and 0 if assigned to control. And we write a linear model relating $Z$ and $Y$ as below, where $\beta_1$ represents the difference in means of $Y$ between units with $Z=1$ and $Z=0$:

$$
\begin{equation}
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Z_i + e_i
\end{equation}
$$

This is a common practice because we know that the formula to estimate $\beta_1$ in Equation (1) is the same as the difference-in-means when comparing $Y$ across the treatment and control groups:

$$
\begin{equation}
\hat{\beta}_1 = \overline{Y}_{Z=1} - \overline{Y}_{Z=0} = \frac{\cov(Y,Z)}{\var(Z)}.
\end{equation}
$$
This last term, expressed with covariances and variances, is the expression for the slope coefficient in a bivariate OLS regression model. This estimator of the average treatment effect has no systematic error (i.e., it is unbiased), so we can write $E_R(\hat{\beta}_1)=\beta_1 \equiv \text{ATE}$, where $E_R(\hat{\beta}_1)$ refers to the expectation of $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ across randomizations consistent with the experimental design.

Sometimes we have an additional (pre-treatment) covariate, $X_i$, commonly included in the analysis as follows:

$$
\begin{equation}
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Z_i + \beta_2 X_i + e_i
\end{equation}
$$

What is $\beta_1$ in this case? The matrix representation here is: $(\beta X^{T}\beta X)^{-1}\beta X^{T}\beta y$. But it will be more useful to examine the scalar formula:

$$ \hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\var(X)\cov(Z,Y) - \cov(X,Z)\cov(X,Y)}{\var(Z)\var(X) - \cov(Z,X)^2} $$

In large experiments $\cov(X,Z) \approx 0$ because $Z$ is randomly
assigned and is thus independent of background variables like $X$. However in any given finite sized experiment $\cov(X,Z) \ne 0$, so this does not reduce to an unbiased estimator as it does in the bivariate case. Thus, @freedman2008rae showed that there is a risk of bias in using the equation above to estimate the average treatment effect. In contrast, the unadjusted difference in means will be unbiased.

As discussed above, this kind of covariance adjustment will also sometimes counterproductively decrease asmyptotic efficiency relative to an unadjusted difference in means, or may simply fail to improve efficiency as much as we hope. To resolve that issue, @lin_agnostic_2013 suggests the following least squares approach---regressing the outcome on binary treatment assignment $Z_i$ and its interaction with mean-centered covariates:^[Lin adjustment might also mitigate bias; for instance, if the only covariates are dummies for mutually exclusive subgroups or block fixed effects [@lin_agnostic_2013; @miratrix2013adjusting].]

$$
\begin{equation}
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Z_i + \beta_2 ( X_i - \bar{X} ) + \beta_3 Z_i (X_i - \bar{X}) +  e_i
\end{equation}
$$

When implementing this covariance adjustment strategy, remember that every covariate, *including binary indicators used to estimate fixed effects or to control for values of categorical covariates*, should be mean-centered and interacted with treatment.

For instance, imagine a design with two treatment arms (treatment vs control) and three covariates. Linear adjustment for these covariates would involve fitting an OLS regression with *four* slope coefficients (one for the treatment group, and one for each covariate). Lin adjustment for these covariates would instead involve fitting a regression with *seven* slope coefficients (one for the treatment group, one for each mean-centered covariate, and one for each interaction of treatment with a mean-centered covariate).^[The covariates outside the treatment interactions do not actually need to be mean-centered, but the version of each covariate in the interaction term does. E.g., in Equation 4, $\beta_2 (X_i - \bar{X})$ could be replaced by $\beta_2 X_i$, but $Z_i (X_i - \bar{X})$ must be kept as-is. It is often easier to simply only use mean-centered covariates in Lin adjustment here to avoid confusion.]

See the [Green-Lin-Coppock SOP](https://alexandercoppock.com/Green-Lab-SOP/Green_Lab_SOP.html#using-covariates-in-analysis) for more examples of this approach to covariance adjustment. While both @lin_agnostic_2013 and @freedman2008rae focus on a design based framework, @negi2021revisiting discuss the Lin estimator ("full regression adjustment") in a more traditional sampling based framework.

### Illustrating the Lin Approach to Covariance Adjustment

Here, we show how typical covariance adjustment can lead to bias or inefficiency in estimation of the average treatment effect, increasing the overall RMSE (root mean squared error, which is influenced by both bias and variance)---and how using the Lin procedure (or increasing sample size) can reduce the RMSE. In this case, we compare an experiment with 20 units to an experiement with 100 units, in each case with half of the units assigned to treatment by complete random assignment.

We'll use the [DeclareDesign](https://declaredesign.org/) package in the R code to make this process of writing a simulation to assess bias easier.^[For more, see also [this accompanying book](https://book.declaredesign.org/introduction/preface.html).] Much of the R code that follows is providing instructions to the `diagnose_design` command, which repeats the design of the experiment many times, each time estimating an average treatment effect, and comparing the mean of those estimate to the truth (labeled "Mean Estimand" below). We also provide code illustrating how you could accomplish something similar in Stata using manually defined programs and the `simulate` command.

The true potential outcomes in these example data (`y1` and `y0`) were generated using one covariate, called `cov2`, with no treatment effect. In what follows, we compare the performance of (1) the simple estimator using OLS to (2) estimators that use Lin's procedure involving just the correct covariate, and also to (3) estimators that use incorrect covariates (since we rarely know exactly the covariates that help generate any given behavioral outcome).

We'll break this code up into sections to help with legibility. First, in R, we prepare `design` objects (a class used by `DeclareDesign`) for the $n=20$ and $n=100$ designs. Meanwhile, in Stata, we write a program to randomly generate a sample dataset; this program will then be iterated below. In both the R and Stata simulations, we follow a design-based philosophy in which randomness in our estimates across simulations comes only from variation in treatment assignment.

Next, in R, we'll prepare a list of estimators (i.e., models) we want to compare. These include different numbers of (potentially incorrect) covariates, with and without Lin (2013) adjustment. Similarly, in Stata, we'll write another program that generates a single dataset and then applies the same list of estimators to it, saving key results from each.

From the small sample simulation (N=20), we can see that "CovAdj1: Lm, Correct Covariate" shows more bias compared than the estimator using no covariates at all. The Lin approach using only the correct covariate reduces the bias in this case, but does not erase it. Though it is unbiased, the unadjusted estimator has fairly low power where as the Lin approach with the correct covariate "CovAdj5: Lin, Correct Covariate" has excellent power to detect the 1 SD effect built into this experiment. One interesting result here is that the Lin approach is worst (in terms of RMSE) when a mixture of correct and incorrect covariates are added to the linear model following the interaction-and-centering based approach. This illustrates a point mentioned above: as the number of parameters becomes large relative to the sample size (e.g., in small samples, or in moderate sized samples with a complex model), the efficiency costs from reducing the degrees of of freedom may not be worth the asymptotic efficiency advantages of Lin adjustment, particularly when we do not know if the covariates are actually prognostic.

```{r diagnostCovAdj1, echo = F, eval = T}
diagcols <- c(3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11)
kable(reshape_diagnosis(thediagnosisCovAdj1)[,diagcols] )
```

The experiment with $N=100$ shows much smaller bias than the other experiment above. Since all estimators allow us to detect the 1 SD effect (Power=1), we can look to the RMSE column to weigh the overall performance of these estimators. Bias is lower in general, and the unadjusted approach is the least precise (SD Estimate), followed by linear covariance adjustment for the wrong covariates. In this example, the rest of the estimators all perform similarly (illustrating a point above: treatment assignment here is balanced, so the precision benefits of Lin adjustment should be lower). 

```{r diagnostCovAdj2, echo = F, eval = T}
kable(reshape_diagnosis(thediagnosisCovAdj2)[,diagcols] )

The Lin approach works well when covariates are few and sample sizes
are larger, but these simulations show where the approach is weaker: when there are many covariates relative to the number of observations, some of which may not actually be correlated with the outcome. In this case, the estimator involving both correct and irrelevant covariates included 18 terms. Fitting a model with 18 terms using a small sample, e.g. $N=20$, allows nearly any observation to exert undue influence, increases the risk of serious multicollinearity, and leads to overfitting problems in general.

Our team does not often run into such an extreme version of this problem because our studies have tended to involve many thousands of units and relatively few covariates. However, when we do encounter situations where the number of covariates (or fixed effects) we'd like to account for is large relative to the sample size, we consider a few alternative approaches: (1) omitting some covariates; (2) standard linear covariate adjustment; (3) collapsing the covariates into fewer dimensions (e.g., using principal component analysis); or (4) working with a residualized version of the outcome, as described below.

### The Rosenbaum Approach to Covariance Adjustment

@rosenbaum:2002a suggests an alternative approach in which the outcomes are regressed on covariates, ignoring treatment assignment, and then the residuals from that first regression are used as the outcome in a second regression to estimate an average treatment effect. Again, we evaluate this approach through simulation.

First, code we use to generate Rosenbaum (2002) estimators:

With a small sample (N=20), the Rosenbaum-style approach yields very little
bias and quite high power using the correct covariate ("CovAdj6: Resid,
Correct"), but performs poorly in terms of bias and precision with incorrect
covariates.

kable(reshape_diagnosis(thediagnosisCovAdj3)[7:9,diagcols])

With a larger experiment, the bias goes down, but coverage is still relatively worse when incorrect covariates are included. We speculate that performance might improve if we fit covariance adjustment models that produce residuals separately for the treated and control groups.

kable(reshape_diagnosis(thediagnosisCovAdj4)[7:9,diagcols])

## How to choose covariates for covariance adjustment?

Our analysis plans commonly specify a few covariates based on what we know about the mechanisms and context of the study. In general, if we have a measurement of the outcome *before the treatment was assigned* --- the baseline outcome --- we try to use it as a part of a blocking or covariance adjustment strategy.

When we have access to many covariates, we may sometimes use simple machine learning methods to select variables that strongly predict the outcome, such as a lasso model. In particular, we tend to prefer the *adaptive lasso* rather than a simple lasso because it has better theoretical properties [@zou2006adaptive], but also because the adaptive lasso tends to produce sparser results --- and the bias from covariance adjustment can sometimes be significance if we include too many non-prognostic covariates.

## Block-randomized trials {#blockrandanalysis}

We design block-randomized trials by splitting units into groups based on predefined characteristics --- covariates that cannot be changed by the experimental treatment --- and then randomly assigning treatment within each
group. We use this procedure when we want to increase our ability to detect
signal from noise. It assumes that the noise, or random variation in the outcome measure, is associated with the variables that we use to assign blocks. For example, if we imagine that patterns of energy use will tend to differ according to size of family, we may create blocks or strata of different family sizes and randomly assign an energy saving intervention separately within those blocks.

We also design block-randomized experiments when we want to assess effects within and across subgroups (for example, if we want to ensure that we have enough statistical power to detect a *difference in effects* between veterans and non-veterans). If we have complete random assignment, it is likely that the proportion of veterans assigned treatment will not be exactly same as the proportion of non-veterans receiving treatment. However, if we stratify or block the group on military status, and randomly assign treatment and control within each group, we can then ensure that equal proportions (or numbers) or veterans and non-veterans receive the treatment and control.

Most of the general ideas that we demonstrated in the context of completely randomized trials have direct analogues in the case of block randomized trials. The only additional question that arises with block randomized trials is about how to weight the contributions of each individual block when calculating an overall average treatment effect or testing an overall hypothesis about treatment effects. We begin with the simple case of testing the sharp null of no effects when we have a binary outcome --- in the case of a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test the weighting of different blocks is handled automatically.

### Testing binary outcomes under block randomization: Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test for K X 2 X 2 tables

For block-randomized trials with a binary outcome, we might use the CMH test to evaluate the null of no effect.^[As discussed above, by "binary outcome," we mean that there are only two possible values, and we have recorded one or the other. Usually, we use indicator variables (0, 1) to record these outcomes.] This is one way of keeping the outcomes for each strata separate rather than pooling them together --- under blocking, we are effectively repeating the same experiment separately within each stratum. The CMH test tells us if the odds ratios across strata support an association between the outcome and treatment [@cochran_methods_1954;@mantel_statistical_1959].

To set up the CMH test, we need *k* sets of 2x2 contingency tables. Suppose
the table below represents outcomes from stratum *i* where A, B, C, and D are
counts of observations:

Assignment| Response  | No response | Total
--------- |---------- |----------   |----------
Treatment | A         | B           | A+B
Control   | C         | D           | C+D
Total     | A+C       | B+D         | A+B+C+D = T

The CMH test statistic takes the sum of the deviations between observed and expected outcomes within each stratum ($O_{i}$ and $E_{i}$, respectively), squares this sum, and compares it to the sum of the variance within each strata:

$$
CMH = \frac{\big[\sum_{i=1}^{k} (O_{i} -
E_{i})\big]^{2}}{\sum_{i=1}^{k}{\mathrm{\var}[O_{i}]}}
$$

where $$O_{i} = \frac{(A_i+B_i)(A_i+C_i)}{T_i}$$

and $$\var[O_{i}] =
\frac{(A_i+B_i)(A_i+C_i)(B_i+D_i)(C_i+D_i)}{{T_i}^2(T_i-1)}$$

In large-enough samples, if there are no associations between treatment and
outcomes across strata, we would expect to see an odds ratio equal to 1. Across randomizations of large-enough samples, this test statistic follows an asymptotic $\chi^2$ distribution with degrees of freedom = 1.

For a standard two-arm trial, the odds ratio for a given stratum would be:

$$OR = \frac{A/B}{C/D} = \frac{AD}{BC}$$

Across strata, could then find an overall common odds ratio as follows:

$$
\begin{equation}
 OR_{CMH} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} (A_{i}D_{i}/T_{i})}{\sum_{i=1}^{k}{B_{i}C_{i}}{T_{i}}}
\end{equation}
$$
If this common odds ratio is substantially greater than 1, then we should suspect that there is an association between the outcome and treatment across strata, and the CMH test statistic would be large. If $OR_{CMH} = 1$, this would instead support the null hypothesis that there is no association between treatment and the outcome, and the CMH test statistic would be small.

We could also use the CMH test to compare odds ratios between experiments, rather than comparing against the null that the common odds ratio = 1.

### Estimating an overall average treatment effect {#blockrandate}

Whether or not we randomly assign a policy intervention within blocks or strata, our team nearly always reports a single estimate of the average treatment effect. To review, we define the overall ATE (the theoretical estimand) as a simple average of the individual treatment effects. For two treatments, we might write this individual-level causal effect as $\tau_i = y_{i,0} - y_{i,1}$. We'd therefore express the overall (true) ATE across our sample as as $\bar{\tau}=(1/n) \sum_{i=1}^n \tau_i$. Unfortunately, this quantity is unobservable.

In blocked designs, we have randomly assigned the intervention within each block independently. As we note above, this (1) increases precision and (2) supports more credible subgroup analysis. How might we "analyze as we have randomized" to learn about $\bar{\tau}$ using observable data? Our approach is to build up from the block-level. See @gerber_field_2012 for more context.

Say, for example, that the unobserved ATE within a given block, $b$, was $\text{ATE}_{b}=\bar{\tau}_b=(1/n_b)\sum_{i=1}^{n_b} \tau_{i}$. Here, we are averaging the individual level treatment effects ($\tau_{i}$) across all $n_b$ people in block $b$. Now, imagine that we had an experiment with blocks of different sizes (and perhaps with different proportions of units assigned to treatment --- e.g., certain blocks may be more expensive places in which to run an experiment). We can learn about $\bar{\tau}$ by first reframing it as the block-size weighted average of the true within-block treatment effects:^[We illustrate the equivalence between $\bar{\tau}$ and $\bar{\tau}_{\text{nbwt}$ in our code below: the comparison between `trueATE1` and `trueATE2`.] $$\bar{\tau} = \bar{\tau}_{\text{nbwt}} = (1/B) \sum_{b=1}^B (n_b/n) \bar{\tau}_b$$

We can then estimate $\bar{\tau}_{\text{nbwt}}$ based on its observable analogue, just as we have with a completely randomized experiment. Blocks are essentially their own randomized experiments, so we can estimate each $\bar{\tau}_b$ using the following unbiased estimator, where $i \in t$ means "for $i$ in the treatment group" and where $m_b$ is the number of units assigned to treatment in block $b$: $$\hat{\tau}_b=\sum_{i \in t} Y_{ib}/m_b - \sum_{i \in c} Y_{ib}/(n_b - m_b)$$

We would then plug the $\hat{\tau}_b$ estimates into the expression for $\bar{\tau}_{\text{nbwt}}$ above, yielding $\hat{\bar{\tau}}_{\text{nbwt}}$. *Note that many people do not use this unbiased estimator because its precision is worse that those of another, slightly biased estimator.* We illustrate both methods below, the block-size weighted estimator and what we call the "precision-weighted" estimator. We also offer some reflections on when a biased estimator that tends to produce answers closer to the truth might be preferred over an unbiased estimator where any given estimate may be farther from the truth.

The precision-weighted estimator is based on *harmonic-weights*. We have also tended to call it a "precision-weighted average." The weights combine block size, $n_b$, and the proportion of the block assigned to treatment, $p_b = (1/n_b) \sum_{i=1}^{n_b} Z_{ib}$, for a binary treatment, $Z_{ib}$. The harmonic weight for each block is $h_b = n_b p_b (1 - p_b)$, and the theoretical estimand is then: $$\bar{\tau}_{\text{hbwt}}= (1/B) \sum_{b=1}^B (1/h_b) \bar{\tau}_b$$

This approach may sound unfamiliar. But using precision weights to average a set of within-block treatment effect estimates is equivalent to the more common practice of regression adjustment for linear, additive blocked fixed effects (and we show an example of this in our code below).

Two more points are worth emphasizing. First, by weighting blocks proportionally to their contributions to overall sample size, $\bar{\tau}_{\text{nbwt}}$ effectively treats all units equally in terms of their contributions to the ATE. In contrast, $\bar{\tau}_{\text{hbwt}}$ weights treatment effects from blocks (and therefore the individuals within them) relatively less if the within-block treatment probability is closer to 0.5.^[A block of 100 units would have a harmonic weight of 25 with a treatment probability of 0.5 $(100 \times 0.5 \times 0.5)$, but a harmonic weight of 18.75 under an alternative treatment probability of 0.25 $(100 \times 0.25 \times 0.75)$. Notice that within-block treatment effect estimates are then multiplied by the inverses of these harmonic weights.]

Second, it should be clear from the expression for $h_b$ above that the precision-weighted approach will give no weight to units in blocks where the probability of treatment is 0 or 1 (i.e., all units are eiter treated or untreated, due perhaps to treatment administration issues). What may not be obvious yet is that the unbiased, block-size weighted approach suffers from the same problem. Treatment probabilities may not factor into $n_b/n$, but these are block-level weights that we can't apply without a within-block treatment effect estimate (which we cannot calculate in the absence of within-block variation in treatment). Moreover, the unit level expression for these unbiased weights *is* a function of the within-block treated proportion $(p_{ib})$:

$$nbwt_{i} = Z_{i}/p_{ib} + (1-Z_{i})/(1 - p_{ib})$$

For reference, an expression for unit-level precision-weights is:

$$hbwt_{i} = nbwt_{i} \times p_{ib} \times (1 - p_{ib})$$

Now, we'll show multiple approaches to applying these estimators. We'll also demonstrate (1) that ignoring the blocks when estimating treatment effects can produce problems in both estimation and testing, and (2) that the block-size weighted approaches are unbiased but possibly less precise than the precision weighted approaches.

To make the differences between these estimation approaches more vivid,
we've create a dataset with blocks of widely varying sizes. Half of the blocks have half of the units assigned to treatment and the other half 10% of the units assigned to treatment. Notice also that the baseline outcomes are strongly predicted by the blocks ($R^2$ around $`r round(blockpredpower,2)`$).

We'll use `DeclareDesign` (in R) to assess bias, coverage and power (or precision) of several different approaches to applying each estimator. We'll also provide a parallel Stata example. The next code block sets up the simulation and also demonstrates different approaches to estimating an ATE (as usual, we can only do this because we are using simulation to compare these different statistical techniques in a setting where we know the true data generating process).

with(dat2, table(treatment=Z,blocknumber=b))

With those simulations prepared, we'll start by comparing multiple approaches to getting an unbiased block-size-weighted average treatment effect estimate, $\bar{\tau}_{\text{nbwt}}$. Notice that we do not use linear, additive fixed effects adjustment in any of these.^[I.e., we are not employing the least squares dummy variable, or LSDV, method of including fixed effects in a linear regression. For our purposes here, including fixed effects in the regression via a *within-estimator* instead would yield the same results [@cameron2005microeconometrics].] Two of these approaches do include fixed effects dummies, but they are mean-centered and interacted with treatment assignment --- in other words, we include the fixed effects via @lin_agnostic_2013 adjustment.^[See also @miratrix2013adjusting]

1. `simple_block` refers to calculating mean differences within blocks and then taking the block-size weighted average of them
2. `diffmeans` uses the `difference_in_means` function from the `estimatr`
package [@R-estimatr]
3. `lmlin` applies Lin covariance adjustment *via* block indicators, using the `lm_lin` function
4. `lmlinbyhand` verifies that function using matrix operations; see [this entry](https://alexandercoppock.com/Green-Lab-SOP/Green_Lab_SOP.html#taking-block-randomization-into-account-in-ses-and-cis) from the Green lab's SOP.
5. `regwts` uses the basic OLS function from R `lm` with appropriate weights.

Let's compare the estimates themselves using a single dataset before running our simulation:

As noted above, weighting by block size allows us to define the average treatment effect in a way that treats each unit equally. And we have just illustrated six different ways to estimate this effect. If we want to calculate standard errors for these estimators (e.g., to produce confidence intervals), we will, in general, be leaving statistical power on the table in exchange for an easier to interpret estimate, and an estimator that relates to its underlying target in an unbiased manner.

Next, we show an approach to blocking adjustment that is optimal from the perspective of statistical power, or narrow confidence intervals. As discussed above, we call this the "precision-weighted" average treatment effect.^[See Section 5 of @hansen_covariate_2008 for proof that this kind of weighting is optimal from the perspective of precision.] In some literatures, it's typical to use OLS regression machinery to calculate an ATE that is weighted to account for blocking --- i.e., a "Least Squared Dummy Variables" (LSDV) approach to including block fixed effects in a regression. We show here that this is simply another version of the precision-weighted ATE estimator.

1. `simple_block` calculates a simple differences of means within blocks and
then takes a weighted average of those differences, using precision
weights
2. `lm_fixed_effects1` uses `lm_robust` with binary indicators for blocks
3. `lm_fixed_effects2` uses `lm_robust` with the `fixed_effects` option including a factor variable recording block membership
4. `direct_wts` uses `lm_robust` without block-indicators but with precision weights
4. `demeaned` regresses a block-centered version of the outcome on a block-centered version of the treatment indicator (i.e., including block fixed effects through a *within estimator*).

Let's compare the estimates themselves using a single dataset first:

Now, we claimed that the block size weighted estimator is unbiased but perhaps less precise than the precision-weighted estimator. In R, we'll use `DeclareDesign` to compare the performance of those estimators and illustrate our point. We implement those estimators as functions passed to the `diagnose_design` function in the next code block. In Stata, we use the same approach as above, passing manually-written programs to `simulate`.

   mean_estimand = mean(estimand),
   mean_estimate = mean(estimate),
   bias = mean(estimate - estimand),
   sd_estimate = sqrt(pop.var(estimate)),
   mean_se = mean(std.error),
   rmse = sqrt(mean((estimate - estimand) ^ 2)),
   power = mean(p.value <= 0.05),
   coverage = mean(estimand <= conf.high & estimand >= conf.low)
   )

## Perform the simulation
sims <- 200
set.seed(12345)
thediagnosis <- diagnose_design(thedesignPlusEstimators, sims=sims, bootstrap_sims = 0, diagnosands = diagnosands)
```

We can see in the diagnostic output below that the estimators using block-size weights (E2, E3, E4, or E5) all eliminate bias (within simulation error).^[We've omitted power, since all the estimators in this example have a power of approximately 100%] The estimators ignoring blocks (E0 and E1), are biased, and in this particular simulation the precision weighed estimators (E6--E9) are also highly biased --- with some of them also producing poor "coverage" or false positive rates (E7 and E9).

This output also shows us the "SD Estimate" (which is a good estimate of the standard error of the estimate) and the "Mean SE" (which is the average of the analytic estimates of the standard error). In the case of E2, E3, E4 or E5 the Mean SE is larger than the SD Estimate --- this is good in that it means that our analytic standard errors will be conservative. However, we also would prefer that our analytic standard errors not be *too* conservative.

```

```

The simulated outcome data we used here is highly skewed by design. This helps illustrate that the biases of precision-weighted estimates could be exacerbated by common problems in administrative data like skewed outcomes or zero-inflation (i.e., many 0s). In this case, the skew even prevents us from illustrating the precision benefits of harmonic weights.

One solution we could apply in this case is rank-transforming the outcome measure. This transformed outcome nearly erases the bias from the block-size weighted estimators, and the precision-weighted approaches also perform as expected. However, ignoring the blocked design is still a problem --- E0 and E1 continue to show substantial bias. Moreover, notice here and above that although using regression weights alone to apply these blocking adjustments (rather than, e.g., an appropriate fixed effects specification) produces the right estimates, it does so at the cost of a larger standard error.

In a pair-randomized design, for instance, we know that bias should not arise from ignoring the blocking structure. But we could still improve precision by taking the pairing into account [@bowers2011mem]. This final simulation changes the design to still have unequal sized blocks, but with a uniform probability of treatment assignment in each. Here, only two estimators show appreciable bias (E5 and E8). However, ignoring the blocks leads to overly conservative standard errors.

#### Summary of Approaches to the Analysis of Block Randomized Trials

Our team prefers block randomized trials because of their potential to increase statistical power, as well as their ability to let us focus on subgroup effects. Our approach has been guided by evidence like the simulations we present above: we "analyze as we randomize" to avoid bias and increase statistical power, and we are careful in our choice of weighting approaches. Different designs will require different analytical decisions --- sometimes we may be willing to trade a small amount of bias for a guarantee that our estimates will be closer to the truth and more precise, on average (i.e. get lower mean-squared error, but more bias). Other studies will be so large or small that one or another strategy will become obvious. We use our Analysis Plans to explain our choices, and simulation studies like those shown here when we are uncertain about the applicability of statistical rules of thumb to any given design.

## Cluster-randomized trials {#clusterrandanalysis}

In a cluster randomized trial, treatment is assigned at the level of larger groups of units, called "clusters," instead of at the individual level.^[It's also possible to have trials where treatment is influenced *but not entirely determined* at the cluster level.] These studies tend to distinguish signal from noise less effectively than an experiment where we assign treatment directly to individuals --- i.e., they have less precision. The number of independent pieces of information available to learn about the treatment effect will generally be closer to the number of clusters (each of which tends to be assigned to treatment independently of each other) than the number of dependent observations within a cluster (See EGAP's [10 Things You Need to Know about Cluster Randomization](https://egap.org/resource/10-things-to-know-about-cluster-randomization/)).^[When treatment assignment is *influenced by clustering* but not completely determined at the cluster level, standard error adjustments for clustering will tend to be too conservative. See @abadie2023should for more discussion of this and some potential solutions.]

Since we analyze as we randomize, a cluster randomized experiment may require that we (1) weight cluster-level average treatment effects by cluster size if we are trying to estimate the average of the individual level causal effects [@middleton2015unbiased]. They also require that we (2) change how we calculate standard errors and $p$-values to account for the fact that uncertainty is generated at the level of the cluster and not at the level of the individual [@hansen_covariate_2008; @gerber_field_2012]. For example, imagine that we had 10 clusters (administrative offices, physicians groups, etc.) with half assigned to treatment and half assigned to control.

Although our example data has `r ndat3` observations, we do not have `r ndat3` pieces of independent information about the effect of the treatment because people were assigned in groups. Rather we have some amount of information in between `r ndat3` and the number of clusters (in this case, 
`r length(unique(dat3$cluster))`). We can see above that the number of
people within each cluster --- and notice that all of the people are coded as
either control or treatment because assignment is at the level of the cluster.

Before continuing, in R, let's set up some `DeclareDesign` elements for a simulation of clustered experimental designs. We'll do some comparable preparation in Stata.

In everyday practice, with more than about 50 (equally-sized) clusters, we often produce estimates using more or less the same kinds estimators as those above, but changing our standard error calculations to instead rely on `CR2` cluster-robust standard error [@pustejovsky2019cr]. We show two approaches to such adjustment.

First, the design-based `difference_in_means()` function in R:^[See the `estimatr` [mathematical notes](https://declaredesign.org/r/estimatr/articles/mathematical-notes.html) for more detail on how this is implemented.]

```{r simplecr1}
## CR2 via difference in means
estAndSE4a <- difference_in_means(Y~Zcluster, data=datCluster, clusters=cluster)
estAndSE4a
```

Second, via linear regression with an appropriate error adjustment:

### Bias when cluster size is correlated with potential outcomes

When clusters have unequal sizes, in addition to adjusting our standard error calculations, we might worry about bias as well [@middleton2015unbiased] (see also this [Declare Design blog post](https://declaredesign.org/blog/bias-cluster-randomized-trials.html)). Here, we demonstrate how bias could emerge in the analysis of a cluster randomized trial, as well as how to reduce that bias.

The results of our simulation show how certain approaches can yield very biased estimates, while other approaches can reduce the bias. With variaion in cluster size, the C5 and C6 estimators have the lowest bias in this particular example (with very few clusters). We also see evidence of problems with some of these standard errors --- the actual standard errors (in "SD Estimate") should be much higher than those estimated by the approaches ignoring the clustered design (C0 and C1).

kable(reshape_diagnosis(thediagnosisCluster)[, c(3, 6:9, 11:12)])

### Incorrect false positive rates from tests and confidence intervals

When we have few clusters, analytic standard errors could lead to incorrect false positive rates for our hypothesis tests or confidence intervals, even after we adjust our standard errors for clustering (e.g., using the default adjustment in Stata, CR1). The CR2 errors OES prefers tend to perform slightly better in settings with fewer clusters [@pustejovsky2019cr]. We demonstrate below using CR2 errors rather than CR1 can sometimes help ensure that the false positive rates of our hypothesis tests is controlled correctly.

To distinguish between (1) the problems of bias arising from unequal sized clusters and (2) problems of false positive rates or poor covereage arising from the presence of few clusters, we use a design with equal numbers of units per cluster:

In this case, with 10 equal sized clusters, a simple outcome, and equal numbers of clusters in treatment and control, we see that the CR2 standard error controls the false positive rate (*less than* 5% of the 1000 simulations testing a true null hypothesis of no effect return a $p$-value of less than .05) while the default "Stata" (CR1) standard error has a slightly too high false positive rate of `r fprateStata05` at the 5\% error level.

<!-- The following plot shows that, in this case the Stata standard error tends to -->
<!-- make slightly too many false positive errors (shown by open circles above the -->
<!-- 45 degree line) and the CR2 standard error tends control the error rate of the -->
<!-- test (with black dots below the 45 degree line). -->

```{r plotfpr, eval = F, echo = F}
## commenting out for now
plot(ecdf(fpresCR2),pch=19)
plot(ecdf(fpresStata),pch=21)
abline(0,1)
```

If a simulation like the one above shows false positive rate problems with the CR2 standard error as well, we may prefer to rely on permutation-based randomization inference. For more discussion of issues with standard error calculation in the presence of few clusters, and examples of some other possible approaches to testing with few clusters, see @esarey2019practical.
